\section{Introduction }
	\subsection{Purpose}
	  The purpose of this Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document is to provide a description about the features and use cases of the Ticket Tonight App 1.0. It will cover all functional and nonfunctional requirements of the product, as well as its UI and technologies being used.
	\subsection{Project Scope}
	  The goal of Ticket Tonight, as its name suggests, is to provide event recommendation, event search and ticket purchase service which are oriented to last minute decision. We use Ticketmaster’s own database to fetch corresponding events and infused with users affinity data, finally generate choices for events which are still available tonight.  Ticket Tonight will send notifications to inform users about events which are still available tonight, based on users’ location, preference, event date and budget, and lead users to ticket purchase page once they decide to go.
