\section{External Interface Requirements}
	\subsection{User Interfaces}
		Ticket tonight will follow iOS human interface guideline. Wireframes and mockups TBD.
	\subsection{Software Interfaces}
		Ticket tonight will fetch and query data from Ticketmaster server via a RESTful interface specified by Ticketmaster. On the server side, the backend system will store user data and transactional data in a dedicated server, which will have a RESTful interface as well. On the client side, the Ticket tonight app will achieve client side caching using NSCache, NSIncrementalStore and Core Data.
